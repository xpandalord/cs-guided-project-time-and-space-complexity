"""
Given two strings `a` and `b`, write a function to determine if `a` is an
**anagram** of `b`.
​
*Note: an anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters
of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.*
​
**Example:**
​
Input: `a` = "anagram", `b` = "nagaram"
Output `True`
​
**Example:**
​
Input: `a` = "bat", `b` = "tar"
Output `False`
